# What's this?

This is a folder to contain all the libraries I copied from GitHub. None of these are written by me.

## Where's `classic.lua`?

In the base folder, renamed to `object.lua`. Also I <!--quote unquote-->fixed the formatting because I hate crunched code. <!--I actually didn't have internet when I needed classic, so I copied it from my phone, line by line. "You have a microUSB cable, why don't use that to copy?" Good question.--> Kept the docs here for the heck of it.

## Note

If you don't want to use a thing, feel free to delete it. Nothing depends on these.
